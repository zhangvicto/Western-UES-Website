    Boilersuit

    <br>
    Boilersuits are grey coveralls. The tradition of coveralls in Engineering began in the 1960s in Sweden and Finland.
    Their original purpose was to be worn when students visited companies but evolved into being used for partying and
    to
    identify their department. These coveralls were eventually adopted by schools in Canada.

    Boilersuits are a tradition at Western Engineering giving students an opportunity to show their Engineering spirit
    and
    pride. Students who are involved in the Eng community are awarded a Boilersuit and become a part of this fun
    tradition.

    The goal of the suit is to be a visual representation of your time as an Engineering student by sewing on patches
    detailing your interests, events and clubs. They are also worn to conferences where patch trading with other schools
    allows you to meet new people and add to your suit. The Boilersuits also host events that give Boilersuits a fun way
    to socialize with like-minded students. Check back soon to this page for updated information on how you can apply to
    be a Boilersuit this year!
