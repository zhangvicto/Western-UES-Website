            Every student enrolled in a Bachelor of Engineering Science at Western is a member of the Undergraduate
            Engineering Society. The UES Council exists to ensure that every society member, every Western Engineering
            student, has the best undergraduate experience possible. This purpose is manifested in action.
            ‍<br>
            <br>
            Our council is dedicated to helping each and every student receive a full Western Engineering experience and
            enjoy their time here. We put on social events to further strengthen the community among our Engineering
            students, providing them with small encounters that spark lifelong friendships. The UES Council supports
            clubs where students can embrace their passions and hone true technical expertise. Discovering what you love
            to do unlocks your potential. We also provide academic and career support. You’re enabled to perform inside
            the classroom and change the world outside of it.
            <br>
            <br>
            The UES Council is the voice of students to the Faculty of Engineering at Western. When the school’s
            interests are aligned with the students’, progress is possible. Time and time again, it’s promised that
            you’ll remember your university years as among the best in your life. We’re here to help keep that promise.
